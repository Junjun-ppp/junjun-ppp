			<p> This document is an explanatory article on entropy elasticity. It is written assuming that the reader already has a basic understanding of thermodynamics.

Entropy elasticity is the property of regularly arranged molecules to revert to an irregular arrangement due to external forces, in accordance with the entropy increasing law.
			Various websites have provided explanations of entropy elasticity, but they are not always easy to understand.
			Here, we will deepen our understanding of entropy elasticity by confirming that the tension (elasticity) of rubber, which is the most easily understood form of entropy elasticity, increases as the temperature of the rubber rises.

		</h3><div class="inyou">
			<p> In this paper, we are going to consider the entropy of a temperature-dependent spring. The flow of this paper begins with a review of the basic axioms of thermodynamics, followed by a review of the theorems, properties, etc. necessary to consider the entropy of springs, and finally by specific calculations to obtain the entropy of temperature-dependent springs, which was the initial objective. The content of the course is designed to have a storyline.
