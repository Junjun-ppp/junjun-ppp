	<div class="inyou">
        <p>This section deals with introductory differential equations as a part of physical mathematics. 
         The emphasis is on ease of understanding without mathematical rigor. In preparing this document, 
         we mainly referred to "Lectures on Differential Equations" by Dr. Akira Kaneko, "Introduction to Analysis", 
         "Introduction to Sets and Topology" by Dr. Kazuo Matsuzaka, and "Detailed Mathematics for Physics and Applied Mathematics" by Dr. Kenichi Goto.
         In this reference, we mainly deal with quadrature, unique existence of solutions,
         and linear differential equation systems, and do not include contents such as series solution methods, Fourier transform, and so on.</p>

		</h3>
			<p> In this section, after considering what differential equations are, explanations of terms and so on are given that will be necessary for future discussions.

			<a href="https://junjun-ppp.github.io/notes/微分方程式入門第2章(web2).pdf "target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapter 2 Quadrature</a>
		</h3>
			<p>In Chapter 2, so-called "solvable" differential equations are treated, and different methods of solving them are studied by means of examples.</p>
		<h3>
			<a href="https://junjun-ppp.github.io/notes/微分方程式入門第3章(ver1).pdf"target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapter 3 Existence Theorems for Solutions</a>
		</h3>
			<p>　In Chapter 3, we consider the existence of solutions to differential equations, in particular the existence of unique solutions. This chapter is theoretically important in order to consider more abstract differential equations in the future.</p>
		<h3>
			<a href="aaa "target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapter 4: Linear systems of differential equations　(Working on it!)</a>
		</h3>
			<p>　　In Chapter 4, we discuss linear differential equations at a higher level of abstraction.</p>
