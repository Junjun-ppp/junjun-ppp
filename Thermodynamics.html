		</h3><div class="inyou">
			<p> This document is an explanatory article on entropy elasticity. It is written assuming that the reader already has a basic understanding of thermodynamics.

Entropy elasticity is the property of regularly arranged molecules to revert to an irregular arrangement due to external forces, in accordance with the entropy increasing law.
			Various websites have provided explanations of entropy elasticity, but they are not always easy to understand.
			Here, we will deepen our understanding of entropy elasticity by confirming that the tension (elasticity) of rubber, which is the most easily understood form of entropy elasticity, increases as the temperature of the rubber rises.

		</h3><div class="inyou">
			<p> In Chapter 2, the concept of "flow" is introduced using events in a 1D system as an example, and students learn how to handle nonlinear dynamics through problem exercises. The concept of "bifurcation", which is very important academically, is also studied and several types of bifurcations are introduced. Finally, oscillators are also considered from the point of view of flow on a circumference, using various events as examples.
