        <p> Here we will learn about nonlinear dynamics and chaos. The following literature has been prepared for reference.</p>

	    <p> Basically, we follow [1]. We have tried to make it possible to read the book in a narrative manner by discarding topics, exercises, etc. from [1]. I also referred to [2] and [3] for mathematical descriptions that I thought were necessary in some places. I would like to go into the content of [4], but it does not look like I will be able to get there.</p>
	    <p> The purpose of this material is only to refine the way of dealing with nonlinear dynamics and intuition, not to develop a mathematically rigorous theory. We plan to prepare a document on dynamical systems theory that develops a more mathematically rigorous approach. The ultimate goal is to put the structure together as a Hamiltonian systems theory.

			<p>In Chapter 3, we consider the existence of solutions to differential equations, in particular the existence of unique solutions. This chapter is theoretically important in order to consider more abstract differential equations in the future.</p>
